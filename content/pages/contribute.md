# Contributing

Everybody is welcome to contribute to Static Website Hosting, just fork the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cosmicjs/staticwebsitehosting.org) and send a pull request.
Each static site generator is a markdown file in the `content/projects` directory.

Make sure to follow the following rules:

- **Static Website Hosting:** No compute-involved website hosting options meaning the hosting provider must have the option to enable a CDN for optimized global static asset distribution.
- **Stick to the format:** Fill out all the same fields as the other static website hosting providers in `content/projects`.
- **Short description:** Keep all the details for the body text, keep the description for the overview page short and sweet.
